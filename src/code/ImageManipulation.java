     * Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images.
     * It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness. Edge detection is used for image segmentation
     * and data extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.
     *
     * There are many different edge detection algorithms. We will use a basic edge detection technique
     * For each pixel, we will calculate ...
     * 1. The average colour value of the current pixel
     * 2. The average colour value of the pixel to the left of the current pixel
     * 3. The average colour value of the pixel below the current pixel
     * If the difference between 1. and 2. OR if the difference between 1. and 3. is greater than some threshold value,
     * we will set the current pixel to black. This is because an absolute difference that is greater than our threshold
     * value should indicate an edge and thus, we colour the pixel black.
     * Otherwise, we will set the current pixel to white
     * NOTE: We want to be able to apply edge detection using various thresholds
     * For example, we could apply edge detection to an image using a threshold of 20 OR we could apply
     * edge detection to an image using a threshold of 35
